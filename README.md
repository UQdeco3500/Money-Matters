# Team 3: Money-Matters
Facilitating a collaborative learning experience to improve financial literacy in late primary school aged children.

# Our Prototype
Our team's prototype is an Excel Spreadsheet as it best suited the testing we wanted to conduct in line with our social and mobile objectives. 
As a result, we do not have any code base to upload or describe, and instead, we will share the Google Link to access the Google Spreadsheet prototype: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18EAZ9WM2Rle0nBZHo_WvEpn8MgTHY_4mECRxLyBYqUQ/edit?usp=sharing

# How to Use the Prototype/interact: 
1) Open the link provided to access the prototype.
2)	Acting in a family of four, nominate roles between you, with two parents and two kids required.
3)	As a family, we want you to set a collective savings goal. Examples may be a family holiday, a dinner out, a new TV or a sweet treat in the grocery shop. Agree on a saving plan and set the goal by typing in the goal name cell, description cell and bar chart heading. 
4)	Now, add the cost of the family saving goal to the bar chart by adjusting the vertical axis title and changing the max value for the bar chart. Note that for the prototype's purpose, we are only considering the total goal amount within a week, not what it equates to weekly (the total amount distributed over several weeks). 
5)	Discuss what chores exist in your family and assign each member three chores by changing the cell name.
6)	Assign a monetary value for each chore based on factors like your family's perceived difficulty, necessity, or importance to decide how youâ€™ll save the money towards the collective goal. 
7)	Tick off the chores you completed at the week's end.
8)	Review how the family performed towards the saving goal and open up financial conversations.
